    "Mathematics has been of crucial importance in solving many historical challenges, particularly in the fields of physics and engineering, where mathematical concepts are regularly employed to address problems far beyond the context in which they were originally developed. More recently, mathematical models have been employed to solve problems in the realm of neuroscience, and biology more generally. Mathematical models of the brain make it possible to gain a deep and long-lasting insight into how the brain works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will review the key mathematical tools needed to develop such models of the brain. These tools include differential equations, linear algebra, and numerical analysis."

    "In 1963, Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning the ionic mechanisms involved in excitation and inhibition in the peripheral and central portions of the nerve cell membrane\". Using a combination of electrophysiological recordings and mathematical intuition, they developed a mathematical description of how action potentials are initiate and propagate along a squid giant axon. Their work revolutionised neuroscience research and initiated a new field: mathematical neuroscience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hodgkin and Huxley's mathematical description consisted of four ordinary differential equations, prescribing the rate of change of the membrane potential ($V$) and the 3 additional quantities related to the potassium channel activation ($n$), sodium channel activation($m$), and sodium channel inactivation ($h$).\n",

    "A differential equation prescribes the rate of change of a particular quantity. Consider the expression for unrestricted population growth $$\\frac{{\\rm d}N}{{\\rm d}t}=a N,$$\n",
    "where $N$ is the size of a given population, $t$ is time and $a$ is a parameter describing the growth rate.\n",
    "The derivative $\\frac{{\\rm d}N}{{\\rm d}t}$ refers to the rate of change of $N$ as $t$ is varied, i.e. how is the population size going to change over time. On the right-hand side of the equation, we have an expression that prescribes that change. If $a$ is a positive, our rate of change $\\frac{{\\rm d}N}{{\\rm d}t}$ will be positive, i.e. the population size is going to increase. Whereas if $a$ is a negative, the rate of change $\\frac{{\\rm d}N}{{\\rm d}t}$ will be negative and the population size will decrease. Notice that there is also a $N$ on the right-hand side of the equation. So, if $N$ is small, the amount the population increases/decreases by is also going to be small, but the larger $N$ gets the larger increase/decrease will become.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may help to think about this in a *discretised* manner, e.g. how much do we expect the population to increase each year. Imagine the population of a particular town is 10,000 and it increases by $0.1\\times N$ each year. The change in population size this year will be $0.1\\times 10000 = 1000$, so next year the population size will be 11,000. Now applying the same logic, the population in two years time will be $11000 + 0.1\\times 11000 = 12100$. Below is a piece of code to apply this same logic to compute the population size for the next 25 years."

    "# Synaptic plasticity\n",
    "\n",
    "Action potentials are transmitted from one neuron (presynaptic) to another (postsynaptic) at a synapse. When the action potential reaches the synapse the presynaptic neuron releases neurotransmitter, which causes passages to open between the two neurons. These passages are known as ion channels and once open ions can flow in and out of the postsynaptic neuron. Ions have electrical charge, so ions flowing in and out of the neuron is going to lead to a change in voltage. Once the voltage of the postsynaptic neuron increases past a certain value it will release its own action potential and the cycle repeats. \n",
    "\n",
    "Synaptic plasticity refers to the activity-dependent modification of the strength or efficacy of a synapses, i.e. how much of a change in voltage can one action potential create. Such changes in synaptic strength can modify the function of a neural circuit, enabling us to learn and creating memories. See [Citri & Malenka (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.npp.1301559) for an overview of synaptic plasticity\n",

    "In the 1940s Donald Hebb postulated that *cells that fire together wire together*. The general idea of his theory was that if neuron A and neuron B are regularly activated at the same time, then the synaptic connection between them should gradually become more effective. While if neuron A and neuron B's firing pattern are uncorrelated, the synapse should become less effective. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hebb's theory was later formalised mathematically and there now exist many formulations of Hebbian learning, see  [Gerstner & Kistler (2002)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00422-002-0353-y) for a nice review. \n",
